This is a collection of my Google Kick Start solutions.

# Code and comments
Note that the code will not be super clean since it was created in a very short time span.
However, I will try to give short explainations in the the form of comments created after the competition.
Sometimes, a short breakdown of why my solution does or doesn't work and how it could be improved will be at the start of the solution (as a comment).
